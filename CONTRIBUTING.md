## Workflow

1. If you're looking to help, find a `bug`, `feature`, `help wanted`, `improvement`, or `documentation` issue and claim it to let us know you're working on it. If you're using the project and encounter a bug or think the project could be improved but you're not sure how to implement the improvement, create an issue and label it appropriately; your workflow will end here unless you pick up the issue later. If you don't see something that matches up with what you want to work on or have worked on, skip to the next step.

1. Fork the repo and clone it locally.

1. Setup your upstream (just in case).  
`$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/main-repo/name.git`

1. Create a new branch from the *Develop* branch. Please name your branch based on the type of issue it's referencing, e.g., `bug/description`, `feature/description`, or `improvement/description`.  
`$ git checkout -b feature/magic-numbers develop`

1. Maintain your fork as necessary by staying in sync with the your upstream.
    ```
    git checkout feature/my-new-feature
    git fetch -a
    git pull --rebase upstream develop
    git push --force-with-lease origin feature/my-new-feature
    ```

1. Make your changes and keep pushing commits to the initial branch using `--amend`/`--rebase` as necessary. Don't mix
unrelated issues in a single branch.   
**Note:** Reference issues by the `closes #XXX` or `fixes #XXX` notation in the commit
message. Please use a descriptive, useful commit message that could be used to understand why a
particular change was made.

1. Clean up the branch (rebase with develop to synchronize, squash, edit commits, test, etc.) to
prepare for it to be merged.

1. Open a pull request comparing your fork to the main repo. If you aren't sure your PR will solve the issue
or may be controversial, we're okay with you opening an issue separately and linking to it in
your PR. That way, if the PR is not accepted, the issue will remain and be tracked.   

1. After reviewing your commits for documentation, passed continuous integration (CI) tests,
version bumps, changelogs, and good, descriptive commit messages, a project maintainer can merge your request.

1. Create/update the changelog if necessary.
