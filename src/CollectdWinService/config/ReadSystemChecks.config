    <!-- Add custom process checks here. The entries can be ProcessCheck, ServiceCheck or PortCheck.
        Name          - For a Service check this is the Service Name found by opening the service in the Service Control Manager (note that this is not the Display Name).
                        For a Process check this is the process name as it appears in the performance monitor process list (typically the same as it appears in Task Manager but without the file extension).
                        For a Port check this is used as the name of the check in Metricly in the form "Name.Port".
        Port          - (port checks only) the TCP port to check. The agent verifies that the port is listening.
        Alias         - (optional) an alias to use for the check name in Metricly. If it is not supplied then the process name is used.
        TTLMultiplier - (optional) sets the time-to-live of the check as a multiple of the agent execution interval. For example, if the agent is configured to collect data every 60 seconds (the default) and the check is
                        configured with a TTLMultiplier of 2.5 (the default) then the next check must be received by Metricly within 150 seconds in order to pass. The minimum allowed value is 1.0 but we recommended that
                        it is set higher to allow for processing time and network latency etc.
        Examples:
          <ServiceCheck Name="MSSQLSERVER" Alias="sqlservercheck" TTLMultiplier="2.5"/>
          <PortCheck Name="webserver" Port="80"/>
