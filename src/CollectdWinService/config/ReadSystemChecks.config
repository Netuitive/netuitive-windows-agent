  <Checks>

    <!-- The entries can be ProcessCheck, ServiceCheck, PortCheck or HttpCheck:
         Checks are evaluated at each collection interval (as configured in CollectdWin.config).

        <ProcessCheck Name="powershell"/>
          Where:
            Name          - This is the process name as it appears in the performance monitor process list (typically the same as it appears in Task Manager but without the file extension).
                            A check is sent if a process matching the given name is running on the host server.
                            It is also used as the name of the check in Metricly if Alias is not set.

        <ServiceCheck Name="MSSQLSERVER"/>
            Name          - This is the Service Name found by opening the service in the Service Control Manager (note that this is not the Display Name).
                            A check is sent if a service matching the given name is in the running state on the host server.
                            It is also used as the name of the check in Metricly if Alias is not set.

        <PortCheck Name="webserver" Port="80"/>
            Name          - This is used as the name of the check in Metricly in the form "Name.Port" if Alias is not set.
            Port          - This is the TCP port to check. The agent verifies that the port is listening on the host server.
                            A check is sent if the port is listening for TCP connections

        <HttpCheck Name="MyServiceCheck" Url="http://myservice/endpoint" />
            Name          - This is used as the name of the check in Metricly if Alias is not set.
            Url           - This is the URL to test.
                            A check is sent if an HTTP GET request sent to the given URL returns a successful response. Redirects are automatically followed.
            StatusMatches - (optional) A regular expression to evaluate a successful response code. The default expression is "^2" which matches any 2xx code.
                            Other examples:
                              ^(?!4|5) - any code except 4xx or 5xx
                              ^(2|3)   - any 2xx or 3xx code
            AuthHeader    - (optional) An authorization header to send with the request. e.g., "Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ"

        In addition to the arguments listed above all check types support the Alias and TTLMultiplier options:
            Alias         - (optional) an alias to use for the check name in Metricly.
            TTLMultiplier - (optional) sets the time-to-live of the check as a multiple of the agent execution interval. For example, if the agent is configured to collect data every 60 seconds (the default) and the check is
                            configured with a TTLMultiplier of 2.5 (the default) then the next check must be received by Metricly within 150 seconds in order to pass. The minimum allowed value is 1.0 but we recommended that
                            it is set higher to allow for processing time and network latency etc.

            The EnableAgentHeartbeat setting (enabled by default) sends a heartbeat check to Metricly each time the agent collects data.
